# 🌍 OpenWeatherMap API Documentation (Sample Project)

Welcome! This is a technical writing portfolio project that documents two key endpoints of the **OpenWeatherMap API**:

- **Current Weather Data**
- **5-Day / 3-Hour Forecast**

This sample is written in clear, developer-friendly Markdown and is aimed at beginner-to-intermediate developers who want to integrate weather features into their apps.

- Organizing technical content for real-world use cases

It includes:

- Setup instructions (account + API key)
- Detailed explanations of each API endpoint
- Sample requests and responses
- Error codes and handling tips
- Best practices for implementation
