## üß∞ Troubleshooting Tips

- **Double-check your endpoint**: Make sure you're using the correct path (e.g. `/data/2.5/weather`)

- **Verify your parameters**: Ensure all required parameters (`q`, `appid`, etc.) are included

- **Watch for typos**: Especially in the city name or URL format

- **Respect rate limits**: Too many requests can lead to temporary blocks

- **Check plan access**: Some endpoints (like historical data) require a paid subscription.
